          'Snuggy's Eventyr' is an interactive web game that I conceptualized and developed as an individual project at KEA. 
          I was responsible for the entire process – from overall concept development to character design, animation production, 
          and implementation of interactions. The game is designed with young children as the primary target audience and is built 
          on intuitive interaction, making it easy for everyone to understand and engage with. The game's symbolic visual elements 
          are specifically adapted to children's perspective and stimulate their imagination, while providing a natural reward 
          experience through small achievements.

              <p>
                The idea for Snuggy’s Eventyr originated during an idea workshop using the “dictionary method” for concept generation.
                I randomly selected three words — “a pig”, “in the sky”, and “to sail” and combined them to create the foundation of the story.
                Through a mind map, I developed the world and storyline further, and during the process, I changed the main character 
                from a pig to the raccoon pirate Snuggy to create a more dynamic and playful atmosphere.
                The project focused less on a complex narrative and more on visual rhythm and sensory interaction.
                Movement, delight animation, and sound were designed to deliver intuitive feedback, allowing even short interactions to feel 
                responsive and engaging.
                The goal was to create a simple, intuitive, and joyful interactive experience that young children can easily enjoy.

              <p class="leading-relaxed">
                My game is about Snuggy, a small raccoon pirate, who embarks on a journey to find the treasure in Cotton Candy 
                Town in the sky. Cotton Candy Town uses cotton candy as lightning rods on their buildings, but due to frequent 
                thunderstorms, they are always in short supply. The townspeople offer to trade a treasure chest filled with candy 
                in exchange for cotton candy. However, a rival pirate is also after the treasure and tries to stop Snuggy by throwing 
                bombs. The game's goal is simple. If Snuggy collects at least 15 pieces of cotton candy, the town will give him the 
                treasure chest as a reward, and thanks to the extra cotton candy, the town will be protected from lightning. 
                But if he fails, the rival pirate will steal the treasure, and the town will remain in danger from the lightning.

              <p class="leading-relaxed">
                To explore the interaction flow, I first designed a low-fidelity paper prototype.
                This allowed me to rapidly experiment with ideas and iteratively refine the screen layout and player navigation.
                For instance, the initial prototype did not include options such as music control or rule settings, but through user 
                testing, these features were added to create a more user-friendly experience.
                This process helped me refine the overall game structure and validate the core interactions before moving on to 
                the digital version.

              <p class="leading-relaxed">
                The final outcome of Snuggy’s Eventyr was developed as an interactive web game.
                Each click provides instant visual feedback and rewarding animations, creating engagement even in short play sessions.
                The bright color palette, simple forms, and smooth motion deliver a friendly and joyful experience for children, while the rhythm of play, feedback, and reward visually expresses the essence of intuitive interaction.
                Through this project, I learned that interactive design can go beyond simple actions — it can expand emotional connection and make users feel truly involved.
                It showed me how storytelling and feedback can turn interaction into the core of the experience itself.
